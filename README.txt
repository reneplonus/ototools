ototools contains a collection of functions I used in my master thesis, so most of the functions actually might be of no use for anyone else (except he or she is working with otoliths and imagePRO 6.0).

If you still want to have a look feel free to go on - you should simply know that this is no official package although I did my very best to stick to the guidlines :)
